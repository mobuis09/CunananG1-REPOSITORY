    <h1>YOU SAY YOU WANT A REVOLUTION</h1>


 You say you want a revolution, well, you know
We all wanna change the world
You tell me that it's evolution, well, you know
We all wanna change the world <br>

<br>
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out?
<br>

<br>
Don't you know it's gonna be alright?
Alright
Alright
 <br>

<br> 
You say you got a real solution, well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution, well, you know
We're all doin' what we can
<br>

<br>
But if you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is, brother, you have to wait
See upcoming rock shows
Get tickets for your favorite artists
<br>

<br>
Don't you know it's gonna be alright?
Alright
Alright
<br>

<br>
You say you'll change the constitution, well, you know
We all wanna change your head
You tell me it's the institution, well, you know
You better free your mind instead
<br>

<br>
But if you go carryin' pictures of Chairman Mao
You ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow
<br>

 <br>
Don't you know it's gonna be
Alright
Alright
Alright
 <br>

 <br>
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright!
